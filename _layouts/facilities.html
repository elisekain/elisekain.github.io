	<p>Our laboratory is well equipped to synthesize and prepare polymer membranes and to characterize transport and other polymer properties. Dedicated transport property measurement cells and equipment are coupled with state-of-the-art analytical equipment to characterize a wide range of water and ion transport properties in polymers. Please feel free to <a href="/contact" title="Contact Page">contact</a> us for more information on our experimental capabilities. In addition to computing resources for data collection and analysis, standard laboratory supplies, and a dedicated ultra-pure water system (Millipore), our laboratory capabilities include:</p>
