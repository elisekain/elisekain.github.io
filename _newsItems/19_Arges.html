title: Geise Research Group Publishes Collaborative Research with the Arges Research Lab
text: Graduate research assistant Kevin Chang and Prof. Geise recently published an article titled <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.9b01802" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stable and highly conductive polycation-polybenzimidazole membrane blends for intermediate temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells</a></em> in <em>ACS Applied Energy Materials</em>. The work was published in collaboration with Prof. Chris Arges and the <a href="https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/carges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arges Research Lab</a> at LSU. The Geise Research Group contributed dielectric property measurement and analysis expertise to advance a mechanistic understanding of the performance of a new class of polycation-polybenzimidazole membranes for intermediate temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.
