title: Chang, Luo, and Bahati Publish Desalination Membrane Research
text: Graduate research assistants Hongxi Luo and Kevin Chang, along with 4th year <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.virginia.edu/our-opportunities/usoar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USOAR</a> undergraduate researcher Kevin Bahati, recently published articles on their research. Their work describes a new approach for enhancing desalination selectivity of polymer membranes by controlling the position of chemical functional groups on the polymer backbone. <br><br>Details about the desalination selectivity of the materials are published in an <em>Environmental Science and Technology Letters</em> article titled <em><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineering selective desalination membranes via molecular control of polymer functional groups</a></em>, and that article was selected as the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/page/policy/editorchoice/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACS Editors' Choice</a> article for July 20, 2019! Additional details about the salt transport properties of the materials, including dielectric relaxation spectroscopy analysis of the thermodynamics of the selectivity increase are reported in a <em>Journal of Membrane Science</em> article titled <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Functional group configuration influences salt transport in desalination membrane materials</a></em>.
