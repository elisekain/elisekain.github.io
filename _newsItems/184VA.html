title: 4-VA Collaborative Research Grant to the Geise Research Group
text: Prof. Geise landed a 4-VA Collaborative Research Grant to support a joint research effort with Prof. Lou Madsen and his group at Virginia Tech. The grant will fund research focused on controlling molecular configuration and diffusion in polymeric membranes for water purification and energy applications. The team will leverage Geise lab expertise in the study of small molecule transport in charged polymer membranes and Madsen lab expertise in NMR diffusometry to engineer advanced membrane materials for membrane-based water purification and energy applications.
