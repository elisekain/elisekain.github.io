title: Battery Research Project Gets Lift From Virginia Space Grant Consortium
text: The Virginia Space Grant Consortium recently awarded the Geise Research Group a grant to support a research project to investigate a new approach to designing polymer electrolyte membranes to make lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries viable for space applications. The project will focus on engineering advanced membranes to be used as battery separators in extreme environments. Batteries made using advanced technologies are expected to be a critical part of addressing space-based energy storage needs associated with NASAâ€™s Artemis Mission for moon and Mars exploration.
